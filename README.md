# TARZAN
> Bypass paste restriction, using keyboard.

### CONTEXT

Some of the apps, mostly web apps have paste restriction which prevents user from pasting content from other places. Usually online exams have this kind of restriction, recently I had to attend an online exam where I had to write an essay on a boring topic, I generated essay using AI, but couldn't use it fully because the site was restricting pasting.

So Introducing <b>Tarzan</b> by pasting it to the Tarzan app, it will type natively to avoid paste restriction.
